	/**
	 * Given an array of n distinct integers and an element x. Search the element x in the array using minimum number of comparisons. Any sort of comparison will contribute 1 to the count of comparisons. For example, the condition used to terminate a loop, will also contribute 1 to the count of comparisons each time it gets executed. Expressions like while (n) {nâ€“;} also contribute to the count of comparisons as value of n is being compared internally so as to decide whether or not to terminate the loop.
	 *
	 * Examples:
	 *
	 * Input : arr[] = {4, 6, 1, 5, 8},
	 *         x = 1
	 * Output : Found
	 *
	 * Input : arr[] = {10, 3, 12, 7, 2, 11, 9},
	 *         x = 15
	 * Output : Not Found
	 */
	/**
	 * The idea is to copy x (element to be searched) to last location so that one last comparison when x is not present in arr[] is saved.
	 *
	 * Algorithm:
	 *
	 * search(arr, n, x)
	 *     if arr[n-1] == x  // 1 comparison
	 *        return "true"
	 *     backup = arr[n-1]
	 *     arr[n-1] = x
	 *
	 *     for i=0, i++ // no termination condition
	 *         if arr[i] == x // execute at most n times
	 *                        // that is at-most n comparisons
	 *             arr[n-1] = backup
	 *             return (i < n-1) // 1 comparison
